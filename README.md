# TurkeyRunnerRepo

Project 7

For our final project, we were given the freedom to make any kind of game we want. I decided to make an endless runner game, 
which is a pretty common type of smart phone app, and thus I thought it would make a fitting final project. The game is fairly
simple: a turkey will run on a road and jump to avoid a van. It's a turkey because I thought of it on Thanksgiving.

The program works similarly to previous animation based games I developed. There is a main Game View, which will be constantly 
redrawing the scene. If there is a collision between the turkey and an enemy car, the game will end and it can be started over.
